The introduction of telegram 0x00BF allows great flexibility in terms of HMI display, error logging and reaction of the system components for specific errors.

The source address and the module ID are valid for the following three errors, with the advantage that up to three errors can be send with one message.  The active errors need to be sorted such, that the error with highest priority is always reported in the first error item, see also chapter *Sorting rules* in the *NSC-CU-InterfaceSpecification*.  *Note 1*: Each token on the EMS bus is considered a system component. Multiple integrated EMS bus tokens in a single device/product are therefore considered to be *multiple* system components. For each token a separate LEL must be maintained! *Note 2*: The support of an LEL is not required if the component doesn’t have own errors specified/defined. *Note 3*: see *CombinedErrorCodeDB* for the list of error codes  **Important**: telegram 0x00BF must be sent always with the complete payload.  **Note: Distribution Methods** The broadcast is scheduled every 10 minutes and after a change in the content of the LEL.",
