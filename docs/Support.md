# Getting Support

If you are looking for EMS-ESP support, have a question or suggestion here are the options:

- If the request is **hardware** related go to [BBQKees' EMS Gateway Documentation](https://bbqkees-electronics.nl/wiki/).
- Reaching out to the **Support Community** on [Discord](https://discord.gg/3J3GgnzpyT) is a good place for asking general questions and chatting with other users. You have better chances to getting fast responses here.
- **Search** in existing open and closed [GitHub issues](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues) as your issue may already be resolved.
- **Search** the [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/discussions) as you might find an answer to your question.
- As a last resort, create a [Problem Report](https://github.com/emsesp/EMS-ESP32/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) on GitHub. See below for the required information.

:::tip important!

    When creating a new GitHub issue make sure that you provide the following information:

    1. Attach the EMS-ESP Support Information. This will show us which EMS devices you have attached. You can fetch the information from the URL [http://&lt;hostname&gt;/api/system/info](http://ems-esp.local/api/system/info) or by downloading by clicking the `Support Information` button from the Help page in the WebUI.
    2. Mention which firmware version you are using in the issue's title. It is strongly recommended you switch to the latest development firmware version before creating an issue as the problem may already have been fixed.
    3. Mention the hardware or gateway board you are using.
    4. State the problem you are experiencing.
    5. State the steps to reproduce the problem.
    6. State the expected behavior.
    7. State the actual behavior.
